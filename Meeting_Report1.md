# The Meeting Report-1 #
We made our first meeting with our team members, discuss and understand the project, do a brainstorming about what properties the project&system could have.<br><br>
Additionally, In this meeting we took following desicions:<br>
•	In one task we will study together of course but for divison of labor we are divided into three parts. So we intends to finish the task easly.<br>
•	For the first task, we thought that we should use which Process Iteration model for this project . We have decided to use the Waterfall Process Model because of we will organise the specification,design and development process seperately. <br>
•	In developing part, we decided to use JavaEE, MSSQL, JSP , HTML ,CSS.<br>
