# About Me #

I am a junior student in Computer Science and Engineering Department.Our Department is very enjoyable as it is tiring for me. Obviously, I always wanted to be a doctor but for now I'm pretty happy that I'm not a doctor because I love my department and I think that I will be happier to be an engineer than a doctor.<br>
In addition to that, I love the writing code so much so the software part of the Computer Engineering is more effective in my life.I hope , all of us (all my friends in our department) will be a very good engineer in the future.
